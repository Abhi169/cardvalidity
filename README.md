# Luhn's Algorithm

A program that will help us to find out the valid and invalid cards by using an algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn (IBM).
Program will ask for input of card number and will show that whether the card is valid or not. If valid, also tell about the issuing authority.


**Thanks For Using The Program.**
